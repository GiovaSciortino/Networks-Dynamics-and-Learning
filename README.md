Homework and laboratories of the [Network Dynamics and Learning](https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/gap.pkg_guide.viewGap?p_cod_ins=01TXLSM&p_a_acc=2021&p_header=S&p_lang=IT) course for the MSc in Data Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Torino.


## Homework 1:
This project aims to investigate the dynamics of flow and capacity in a graph network and develop algorithms and models to optimize network performance and efficiency. Real-world applications of network flow and capacity will also be explored by studying an optimization problem conducted on the Los Angeles road network to find the shortest path and the maximum flow between two nodes. Search for the social-optimum, the Wardrop equilibrium and the construction of tolls in a way to force the user-optimum to the social-optimum A perfect matching algorithm will be developed to solve a fundamental problem in graph theory with practical applications in various domains. The algorithm will evaluate all possible pairings of nodes in a graph based on criteria such as edge weights or node attributes to output a set of node pairs forming a perfect matching.
## Homework 2:
The objective of this project is to investigate the application of Markov chains and French De Groot dynamics in the context of network graphs. The project will analyze network dynamics using the fundamental concepts of Markov chains, including transition matrices, stationary distributions, and random walks. Additionally, the French De Groot dynamic will be examined as a model of opinion dynamics in a network. This model simulates the evolution of opinions among a group of individuals who interact and influence each other's beliefs over time. The study will explore how this dynamic can be used to model opinion spread in a network and how various parameters, such as social influence strength and individual stubbornness, impact the system's dynamics. The project will employ Python, using the NumPy and NetworkX libraries to implement Markov chain and French De Groot dynamic models, and the Matplotlib library to visualize simulation results.
## Homework 3:
 During the fall of 2009 there was a large pandemic of the H1N1-virus, commonly known as the swine-flu. 
During this pandemic it is estimated that about 1.5 million people in Sweden were infected. 
As an attempt to stop the pandemic and reduce excess mortality the government issued a vaccination program beginning in week 40 of 2009. 
During the weeks that followed they vaccinated more than 60% of the Swedish population.
The aim of this homewrok is to simulate the pandemic with the goal of learning the networkstructure characteristics and disease-dynamics parameters of the pandemic in Sweden 2009.
This task will be divided into 4 parts where the focus of each part is to:
1. get started and learn how to:
a. simulate a pandemic on a known graph;
b. generate a random graph;
2. simulate the disease propagation on a random graph without vaccination;
3. simulate disease propagation on a random graph with vaccination;
4. estimate the network-structure characteristics and disease-dynamics parameters for the
pandemic in Sweden during the fall of 2009.
All numbers regarding the H1N1 pandemic in Sweden during the fall of 2009 have been taken
from the a report by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (Myndigheten f¨or samh¨allsskydd
och beredskap, MSB) and the Swedish Institute for Communicable Disease Control (Smittskyddsinstitutet, SMI).

All simulations are written in Python Notebook and use the NetworkX library.
